# OpenWhisk Bootcamp

Hello 👋.

👩‍💻👨‍💻 *Welcome to the [IBM Cloud Functions](https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk/) ([Apache OpenWhisk](http://openwhisk.incubator.apache.org/)) bootcamp!* 👩‍💻👨‍💻

This workshop will teach you how to develop **serverless applications**, composed of loosely coupled microservice-like functions, using an open-source serverless platform.

Starting with getting the development environment set up, it'll move onto creating, deploying and invoking serverless functions for multiple runtimes. Once you are comfortable creating serverless functions, the next step is to connect functions to events, like message queues, allowing microservices to fire automatically. Finally, we'll demonstrate how to expose serverless functions as public API endpoints, allowing to build serverless web applications. 

Welcome to the future of cloud development, you'll never want to manage another server again 😎.

**You, ready? Let's go!** 🚗
